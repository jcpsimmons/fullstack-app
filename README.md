Unfortunately I missed a file in my gitignore that resulted in showing some sensitive information. Because of this I had to copy everything to a dummy branch, delete the master branch and force push all of the files back to the master branch. I had about 55 commits before this point... bummer, but better than having sensitive info in my commit history.

# This is a prototype social network I am working on.

I am working to create a very simple social network website using the MERN stack. I have a good deal of experience with React and Node, but haven't used Express or MongoDB much as of the beginning of this project.

Once I have the network up and running, I will fork this repository and begin to modify it into a social media network where users can log books they've read. The concept is kind of like Goodreads but without all of the bloat.

## Creating this project solves a massive pain-point for me:

I am a **voracious** reader, and like to keep track of what I've read. I average between 50-100 books per year depending on what I'm researching and working on. I used to keep track of these books on Goodreads, but the side is extremely slow, and I don't care to review my books, I just want to log them by date read and share the information with others. Maybe it will be helpful for more people than just me.

Eventually I plan to deploy it on its own domain using Heroku. Stay tuned.
